<h2>The Oprah Effect Database</h2>
<p>This is a project for Department of Linguistic, University of Toronto. It's an online database for 
some cutting-edge research in linguistic. The Oprah effect is an underdescribed phenomenon that involves
an alternation anywhere in the root under affixation. For instance, some speakers of Dutch can pronounce 
the bare root <i>Oprah</i> with the English rhotic, while affixed words such as the diminutive 
<i>Oprahtje</i> must have the native Dutch rhotic. This is a searchable database of Oprah effects reported 
in world's languages. </p>
